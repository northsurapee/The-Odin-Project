    <!--Anchor element : wrapping the element we want to be a link-->
    
    <!--HTML attribute : give additional infomation to an HTML element
                         and always in opening tag
        ex. "use href (hypertext reference) attribute to tell url the anchor will go
             (default is blue color with underline)-->

    <!--href (hypertext reference): is attribute that tell url the anchor will go
        target : is attribute that tell where the link will be opened
                 default is "_self" which open the link in current tab
                 _blank which open the link in new tab
        rel : relation between current page and linked page (use for more security)
              "noopener" -> prevents the opened link access to webpage from which it was opened
              "noreferrer" -> prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage has a link to it-->

    <!--recommendation : always pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".-->

    <!-- Absolute and relative links
         Absolute link -> links to pages on other web "protocal://domain/path"
         relative link -> links to other pages within our own website
                          we use "./" before relative file path to tell it is 
                          relative to the current directory of index.html-->
