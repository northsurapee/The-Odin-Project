Effective commits consist of 2 seperate parts
1. subject : a brief summary of the change you made
2. blank line
3. body (for a commit that need a bit of explanation) : describe the problem your commit solves and how

ex. Should commit using text editor of vscode not -m option.

When to commit?
- commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code
